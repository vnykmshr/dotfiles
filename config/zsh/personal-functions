# Personal Functions
# Add your custom functions here for workflows specific to your setup

# Note: Common functions (qc, acp, backup, mkcd, extract, etc.) have been
# moved to the main functions file for better organization. This file is
# reserved for your personal customizations.

# Example: Add project-specific shortcuts
# myproject() {
#     cd ~/projects/myproject && git pull
# # }

# Example: Add environment-specific helpers
# work_vpn() {
#     echo "Connecting to work VPN..."
#     # your vpn connection logic
# }
