# Project Overview

> Professional dotfiles designed for customization, not copy-paste

## Philosophy

**Build your development identity, don't copy mine.**

This project provides a solid foundation and practical examples. The real value comes from understanding the patterns and adapting them to your unique workflow. Great developers don't just copy configurationsâ€”they understand, modify, and evolve them.

## Design Principles

### 1. **Template-Based Configuration**

- Configuration files are templates, not rigid prescriptions
- Personal data (name, email, SSH keys) separated from versioned configs
- Easy to adapt without breaking the core system

### 2. **Modular Architecture**

```
config/
â”œâ”€â”€ zsh/          # Shell environment and functions
â”œâ”€â”€ git/          # Version control templates and aliases
â”œâ”€â”€ nvim/         # Editor configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ tmux/         # Terminal multiplexer setup
â”œâ”€â”€ ssh/          # SSH client configuration templates
â””â”€â”€ workflow/     # Development automation tools
```

### 3. **Progressive Enhancement**

- Works out-of-the-box with sensible defaults
- Each component is optional and independently configurable
- Graceful fallbacks when tools aren't available

### 4. **Professional Quality**

- Clean, maintainable code following industry standards
- Comprehensive test coverage ensuring reliability
- Cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Linux, WSL)

## What's Actually Implemented

### Shell Environment (Zsh)

**What you get**:

- Fast startup (0.158s) with lazy loading
- Smart completion system with caching
- Cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Linux, WSL)
- Modern CLI tool integration (bat, eza, fd, ripgrep, zoxide)

**Performance features**:

- Lazy loading for mise and fzf
- Conditional module loading with DOTFILES_SKIP_* variables
- Optimized PATH management
- Performance monitoring with `shell-bench`

**Customization**:

- `config/zsh/personal-aliases` - Your shortcuts
- `config/zsh/personal-functions` - Your utilities
- Skip modules you don't need with environment variables

### Git Workflow Enhancement

**Smart commit workflow**:

- Context-aware commit message suggestions
- Interactive numbered selection or custom messages
- Suggestions based on file changes (docs, tests, config, etc.)

**Branch management**:

- `gnew feature-name` - Create and switch to branch
- `gswitch main` - Switch branches (shows all if no name)
- `gclean` - Interactive cleanup of merged branches

**Aliases**:

- `gsave` - Add, commit with suggestions, push
- `gpull` - Pull with rebase
- Traditional git aliases (g, ga, gc, gd, etc.)

### Development Automation

**Universal commands**:

- `dev` - Start development server for any project type
- `test` - Run tests for any project type
- `testwatch` - Continuous testing with file watching

**Environment detection**:

- Auto-activate .nvmrc/.python-version files with mise
- Load .env files automatically
- Trigger with `envup` or automatic on directory change

**Other tools**:

- Modern CLI alternatives with fallbacks
- Git workflow enhancement with smart commits
- tmux and Neovim configurations

## Getting Started

### 1. **Understand Before Installing**

```bash
# Review the structure
ls -la config/
cat config/git/gitconfig.template
cat install/setup.sh
```

### 2. **Install with Awareness**

```bash
# See what will happen
make install-dry-run

# Install with control
make install
```

### 3. **Customize Immediately**

- Review and edit `config.json` with your personal info
- Add aliases to `config/zsh/personal-aliases`
- Create functions in `config/zsh/personal-functions`
- Customize prompt in `config/zsh/prompt` or skip with DOTFILES_SKIP_PROMPT=1

## Customization Philosophy

### **Don't Just Copyâ€”Understand**

```bash
# Bad: Blindly copying someone's aliases
alias gp="git push"
alias gc="git commit"

# Good: Understanding and adapting to your workflow
alias gps="git push --set-upstream origin \$(git branch --show-current)"
alias gcm="git commit -m"  # You prefer inline messages
alias gca="git commit --amend"  # You frequently amend
```

### **Build Your Development Identity**

Your dotfiles should answer these questions:

- What languages/frameworks do you work with?
- What's your preferred workflow (terminal vs GUI, vim vs other editors)?
- How do you organize projects and navigate code?
- What repetitive tasks can you automate?

### **Current Git Workflow Enhancement**

**Smart commit suggestions work like this**:

```bash
# When you run gsave, you get context-aware suggestions
gsave
# Suggestions:
# 1. ðŸ“š Update documentation
# 2. feat: add new feature
# 3. fix: resolve bug
# 4. Update performance.md
# Commit message (or number): 1

# Creates commit: "ðŸ“š Update documentation"
```

**Branch management**:

```bash
gnew feature/auth     # Create and switch to branch
gswitch              # Shows all branches to choose from
gclean               # Interactively remove merged branches
```

### **Personal Adaptation Examples**

**Frontend Developer**:

```bash
# Add to config/zsh/personal-aliases
alias dev="npm run dev"
alias build="npm run build"
alias test="npm test"

# Add to config/zsh/personal-functions
npm_fresh() {
    rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
    npm install
}
```

**Backend Developer**:

```bash
# Docker-focused in personal-aliases
alias dc="docker-compose"
alias dcu="docker-compose up -d"
alias logs="docker-compose logs -f"

# Add to personal-functions
db_reset() {
    docker-compose down
    docker-compose up -d postgres
    npm run migrate
}
```

## Advanced Customization

### **Performance Customization**

```bash
# Skip features you don't need
export DOTFILES_SKIP_PROMPT=1        # Use your own prompt
export DOTFILES_SKIP_CROSS_PLATFORM=1  # Skip platform detection
export DOTFILES_SKIP_PERFORMANCE=1    # Skip performance tools

# Measure your changes
shell-bench 5    # Benchmark startup time
```

### **Git Workflow Customization**

```bash
# Extend git-helpers for your workflow
# Add to config/zsh/personal-functions
deploy() {
    gsave && git push origin main
    echo "Deployed to production"
}

feature() {
    gnew "feature/$1"
    echo "Created feature branch: feature/$1"
}
```

### **Environment-Specific Setup**

```bash
# Add to config/zsh/personal-aliases for work
if [[ "$HOST" == "work-laptop" ]]; then
    alias vpn="sudo openconnect work-vpn.company.com"
    alias k="kubectl --context=work"
fi

# Personal laptop
if [[ "$HOST" == "personal-mbp" ]]; then
    alias blog="cd ~/projects/blog && code ."
fi
```

## Quality & Testing

### **Current Quality Measures**

- **Performance**: Fast shell startup with lazy loading
- **Testing**: 20+ pre-commit validation checks
- **Security**: Secret scanning, SSH validation, private key detection
- **Cross-Platform**: Tested on macOS, Linux, WSL

### **Test Your Customizations**

```bash
make test           # Full test suite
make lint           # Shellcheck validation
shell-bench         # Performance impact
```

## Contributing Your Improvements

While this is designed for personal use, improvements to the core system are welcome:

- **Bug fixes**: Always appreciated
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Especially Windows/WSL
- **Template enhancements**: Better separation of personal/shared config
- **Workflow tools**: General-purpose development automation

## Going Further

### **Advanced Topics**

- Setting up development containers with your dotfiles
- Automating dotfile deployment across multiple machines
- Integrating with team development standards
- Building custom completion systems

### **Resources for Inspiration**

- Study other developers' dotfiles for ideas
- Join dotfiles communities for sharing techniques
- Read documentation for tools you use daily
- Experiment with new tools and integration patterns

**Remember**: The best dotfiles are the ones you understand completely and have adapted to your specific needs. Use this project as a foundation, not a destination.
